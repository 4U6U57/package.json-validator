# About
`package.json` files are central for node.js/npm projects. Beyond just valid json, there are required fields to follow the specifications. Of course, there are multiple ones to follow, which makes it trickier.

* [NPM](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/blob/master/doc/cli/json.md)
* [CommonJS Packages 1.0](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.0)
* [CommonJS Packages 1.1](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Packages/1.1)

This tool verifies the package.json against the specification of your choice, letting you know if you have a valid file. The validation reports required fields that you MUST have, warns for fields that you SHOULD have, and recommends optional fields that you COULD have.

# Future ideas...
* Support for NPM specific fields
* An API
* A node based command line interface, that would allow for plugins for editors
* Unit tests
